# Competitive Intelligence Tracker

An AI-powered agent that monitors competitor websites, detects updates, and alerts you in real time.  
Built during the **AI Agent Hackathon** in just 3 days!

---

## What It Does

Startups often struggle to keep track of competitor product launches, feature updates, and campaigns.  
This project automates that by:

- **Monitoring websites** (e.g., product pages, blogs, announcements)  
- **Detecting changes** in content or version updates  
- **Sending alerts** when something changes  
- **Displaying a dashboard** with:
  - Tracked target links  
  - Recent alerts (with before/after diffs)  
  - Auto-refreshing logs  

Instead of manually checking competitor sites, the agent watches them for you.

---

## How It Works

1. **Target Links** – Add the websites you want to track in the web UI  
2. **Monitoring Loop** – The `monitor.py` script fetches and compares changes  
3. **Version Tracking** – If a site changes (e.g., “Version 1” → “Version 2”), it records the difference  
4. **Alerts Dashboard** – Changes show up as **Recent Alerts** in the tracker web interface  
5. **Dark/Light Theming** – The interface can be customized with different color themes  

**Example Demo Flow (as shown in the video):**

- Add a competitor URL in the dashboard  
- Run the monitor → script detects changes  
- Recent Alerts instantly show what changed
